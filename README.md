# Lets Build

> This is a prototype, not (ever?) meant for production use.

Experimental build system heavily inspired by [bazel](http://bazel.build) and [skylark](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/concepts.html). Written to learn the consepts of build systems like [bazel](https://bazel.build), [buck](https://buckbuild.com/), [pants](http://www.pantsbuild.org/) and [please](https://please.build/).

Goals:

* BUILD files written in JavaScript, with extreme limitations on the runtime.
* Docker all the things! (just, because, i, want, to)
