# Lets Build

> This is a prototype, not ever meant for actual use

Experimental build system.

Written to learn the concepts of build systems like [bazel](https://bazel.build), [buck](https://buckbuild.com/), [pants](http://www.pantsbuild.org/) and [please](https://please.build/).

Goals:

* BUILD files written in JavaScript, with extreme limitations on the runtime. Like [skylark](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/concepts.html).
* Docker all the things! (just. because. i. want. to)

fun to do:
* Cache all the things!
* Async Module Loading for BUILD files
